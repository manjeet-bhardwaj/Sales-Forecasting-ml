## ⚙️ Methodology
1. Loaded the sales dataset using Pandas  
2. Converted date column into datetime format  
3. Extracted features such as Month and Year  
4. Visualized sales trends over time  
5. Split data into training and testing sets  
6. Trained a Linear Regression model  
7. Evaluated model performance using MAE and RMSE
